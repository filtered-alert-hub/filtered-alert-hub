      <title>severe thunderstorm warning in effect alerte d'orages violents en vigueur</title>
      <link>https://alert-hub.s3.amazonaws.com/ca-msp-en/2016-08-02-00-08-50-310</link>
      <description>At 7:07 p.m. CDT, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a severe thunderstorm capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.###Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.Severe thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall. À 19h07 HAC, les météorologues d’Environnement Canada surveillent un orage violent pouvant produire des rafales très fortes, de la grêle pouvant atteindre la taille d’une pièce de cinq cents et de la pluie forte.###Les pluies torrentielles peuvent causer des crues soudaines et une accumulation d'eau sur les routes. De fortes rafales peuvent projeter des objets non fixés, endommager des bâtiments peu solides, arracher des branches d'arbres et renverser de gros véhicules. Tout orage qui se formera s'accompagnera probablement de nombreux éclairs. N'oubliez pas que les orages violents peuvent produire des tornades.Une alerte d'orages violents est émise lorsqu'il y a ou qu'il y aura des orages qui s'accompagnent ou qui s'accompagneront probablement d'au moins un des éléments suivants : grosse grêle, vents destructeurs ou pluies torrentielles.</description>

      <description>A low pressure system is forecast to pass near or across the southeastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula Monday evening. Rain, at times heavy, will develop on Monday as the low approaches and will continue through Monday night. Forecast rainfall amounts are generally in the 30 to 50 millimetre range but there is potential for embedded thundershowers which could result in locally higher amounts. As a result, the public is advised to monitor future forecasts from Environment Canada as rainfall warnings may be required.###Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to weatherNLWO@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports to #NLwx. Une dépression devrait envahir ou effleurer l&amp;apos;extrémité sud-est de la péninsule d&amp;apos;Avalon lundi soir.   La pluie, parfois forte, commencera à tomber lundi à l&amp;apos;approche de la dépression et continuera lundi soir et dans la nuit de lundi à mardi. Les quantités de pluie prévues devraient être de l&amp;apos;ordre de 30 à 50 mm; toutefois, il y a un risque d&amp;apos;orages incrustés, ce qui pourrait donner des quantités de pluie plus importantes par endroits.   Par conséquent, on recommande au public de surveiller les prévisions d&amp;apos;Environnement Canada, car des avertissements de pluie pourraient être émis.###Veuillez continuer à surveiller les alertes et les prévisions émises par Environnement Canada. Pour signaler du temps violent, envoyez un courriel à weatherNLWO@ec.gc.ca ou publiez un gazouillis avec le mot-clic #NLMétéo.</description>

      <description>Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts and damaging hail.Thunderstorms have developed along the foothills as a low pressure system develops in Alberta this afternoon. These thunderstorms will continue to grow and move east. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe, with strong winds and large hail the main threats with these thunderstorms. These thunderstorms will persist into the late evening and move east towards the Alberta/Saskatchewan border. The severe thunderstorm watch area may be expanded later this afternoon as the system develops.###Very large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.Severe thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to storm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports to #ABStorm. Les conditions sont propices à la formation d'orages dangereux pouvant produire des rafales causant des dommages et de la grêle causant des dommages.Des orages se sont formés le long des contreforts alors qu&amp;apos;une dépression se forme sur l&amp;apos;Alberta cet après-midi.   Ces orages continueront de s&amp;apos;amplifier et de se diriger vers l&amp;apos;est.   Certains de ces orages pourraient devenir violents, et les principaux risques sont des vents forts et de la grosse grêle.   Ces orages persisteront jusqu&amp;apos;en fin de soirée et se dirigeront vers l&amp;apos;est en direction de la frontière séparant l&amp;apos;Alberta et la Saskatchewan.   Le secteur visé par la veille d&amp;apos;orage violent pourrait être élargi à d&amp;apos;autres régions plus tard cet après-midi à mesure que ce système évoluera.###De la très grosse grêle peut endommager des biens, briser des fenêtres, bosseler des véhicules et causer des blessures graves. De très fortes rafales peuvent endommager des bâtiments, déraciner des arbres et emporter de gros véhicules hors de la route. N'oubliez pas que les orages violents peuvent produire des tornades.Une veille d'orages violents est émise lorsque les conditions atmosphériques sont propices à la formation d'orages qui pourraient s'accompagner d'au moins un des éléments suivants : grosse grêle, vents destructeurs ou pluies torrentielles.Veuillez continuer à surveiller les alertes et les prévisions émises par Environnement Canada. Pour signaler du temps violent, envoyez un courriel à storm@ec.gc.ca ou publiez un gazouillis avec le mot-clic #ABMétéo.</description>

      <description>At 4:07 p.m. MDT, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a line of severe thunderstorms capable of producing strong wind gusts, nickel to ping pong ball size hail and heavy rain.This line of thunderstorms is almost stationary from near Lamont to near Rich Lake. Individual cells within the line are intermittently producing hail up to the size of loonies and locally heavy downpours.###Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.Severe thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall. À 16h07 HAR, les météorologues d’Environnement Canada surveillent une ligne d'orages violents pouvant produire des rafales fortes, de la grêle de la taille d’une pièce de cinq cents  à  une balle de ping-pong et de la pluie forte.Cette ligne d&amp;apos;orages quasi stationnaire s&amp;apos;étend depuis un point près de Lamont jusqu&amp;apos;à un point près de Rich Lake.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;Les cellules individuelles dans la ligne produisent par moments des grêlons atteignant jusqu&amp;apos;à la taille d&amp;apos;une pièce d&amp;apos;un dollar, ainsi que des pluies torrentielles par endroits.###N'oubliez pas que les orages violents peuvent produire des tornades.Une alerte d'orages violents est émise lorsqu'il y a ou qu'il y aura des orages qui s'accompagnent ou qui s'accompagneront probablement d'au moins un des éléments suivants : grosse grêle, vents destructeurs ou pluies torrentielles. ### ###</description>

      <description>At 3:47 p.m. MDT, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a line of severe thunderstorms capable of producing strong wind gusts, nickel to ping pong ball size hail and heavy rain.This line of thunderstorms is almost stationary from areas around southwest Edmonton to near Rich Lake. Individual cells within the line are intermittently producing hail up to the size of loonies and locally heavy downpours.###Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.Severe thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall. À 15h47 HAR, les météorologues d’Environnement Canada surveillent une ligne d'orages violents pouvant produire des rafales fortes, de la grêle de la taille d’une pièce de cinq cents  à  une balle de ping-pong et de la pluie forte.Cette ligne d&amp;apos;orages est quasi stationnaire depuis les secteurs près d&amp;apos;Edmonton sud-ouest jusqu&amp;apos;à près de Rich Lake.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;Les cellules individuelles dans la ligne produisent par moments des grêlons atteignant jusqu&amp;apos;à la taille d&amp;apos;une pièce d&amp;apos;un dollar, ainsi que des pluies torrentielles par endroits.###N'oubliez pas que les orages violents peuvent produire des tornades.Une alerte d'orages violents est émise lorsqu'il y a ou qu'il y aura des orages qui s'accompagnent ou qui s'accompagneront probablement d'au moins un des éléments suivants : grosse grêle, vents destructeurs ou pluies torrentielles.</description>

      <description>Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, damaging hail and torrential rain.###Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.Severe thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to storm.ontario@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports to #ONStorm.For more information:http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html. Les conditions sont propices à la formation d'orages dangereux pouvant produire des rafales causant des dommages, de la grêle causant des dommages et de la pluie torrentielle.###De très fortes rafales peuvent endommager des bâtiments, déraciner des arbres et emporter de gros véhicules hors de la route. N'oubliez pas que les orages violents peuvent produire des tornades. Les pluies torrentielles peuvent causer des crues soudaines et une accumulation d'eau sur les routes.Une veille d'orages violents est émise lorsque les conditions atmosphériques sont propices à la formation d'orages qui pourraient s'accompagner d'au moins un des éléments suivants : grosse grêle, vents destructeurs ou pluies torrentielles.Veuillez continuer à surveiller les alertes et les prévisions émises par Environnement Canada. Pour signaler du temps violent, envoyez un courriel à storm.ontario@ec.gc.ca ou publiez un gazouillis avec le mot-clic #ONMétéo.Pour obtenir plus de renseignements :http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/french/beprepared/beprepared_fr.html.</description>
